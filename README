This is a small game project, mostly intended to be my personal learning experience in programming a bit larger software entity.

Requires boost, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, opengl, glew

For automatic, hourly builds see: http://plantmonster.homeip.net/koodailut/kapteeni/automatic_builds/

There's a small build script in the root directory of the repository called build.sh
